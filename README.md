# Machine_Learning_Telecom_Customer_Churn_Prediction

Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service during a certain time frame. You can calculate churn rate by dividing the number of customers you lost during that time period -- say a quarter -- by the number of customers you had at the beginning of that time period.

## Dataset:

We have a csv with information of 1000 customers.
There are a total of 46 features.
Target variable is churn

## Requirement:

Predict if a customer will churn.
Understanding of data science framework and use of all algorithms / techniques (supervised or unsupervised) discussed in class or lab

## Approach:

Perform exploratory data analaysis
Perform pre-processing steps - dropping columns, imputation, feature engineering, scale features, and creating composite features
Apply logistic regression and XGBoost
Apply oversampling and apply logitic regression and XGBoost
Compare the results
